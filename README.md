# Predator-Card-Game
This is a card game created using HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT technology, its a multi player game designed in such a way that each player has twelve cards on there respective rows,there are four characters in the game and they are 'lion,cheetah, leonophales,and cat' the back of the card is unknown so players dont have idea of what card they are playing untill the card is clicked, although there is a hint that appears on top of the screen when a player move his mouse over each card, the hint gives a vague idea of what character a card could could contain. 

After the card is clicked it translate and moves to a center position  and display the image of what is been played from the character i mentioned earlier, after the two players have played there respective cards, the two cards played will be compared, if lion card and a card with cat or cheetah is played it means the lion card will move back to its initial position and the other card get removed from the game,if cheetah card and a card with cat or leonaphales is played it means the cheetah card will move back to its initial position and the other card get removed from the game, if cat card and a card with leonophales is played it means the cat card will move back to its initial position and the other card get removed from the game,if leonophales card and a card with lion is played it means the leonophlaes card will move back to its initial position and the other card get removed from the game , if the players play the same character like lion and lion or cheetah and cheetah both card will be removed from the game. For evey round of card played in pairs the last player to play would be the first player to play for the next round, if player one play first and player two plays second for the first play that means player two will have to play first for the next play.

  At the end of each round, the player whose cards got finish first  loses the round while other player wins, but if the last card for each player has the same character its a draw game.
